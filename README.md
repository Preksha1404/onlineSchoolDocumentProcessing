# Online School Document Processing
We have created an online platform that would allow students and the school’s registrar to transact regarding school document processing. The old way of processing school paperwork will be phased out as part of this initiative. Digital school documents will take the place of hard copies which is purpose of our website.

The project, “Online School Documents Processing System,” is intended to streamline the processing of school documents by students and the registrar’s office. The project designed and developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.
